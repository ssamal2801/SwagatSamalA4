#Selenium testing
This is Assignment 4 for Software Quality Assurance Technique.
The task is to design the website and test it.
The website has to have a registration page with form validation.
A page to view the latest registration and delete it.
The last page is to view all the records in database.
I have have not used any database in this website, rather have used the local storage of brower so make sure your browser supports local storage.
